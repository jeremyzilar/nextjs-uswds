# Next.js + USWDS

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) that utilizes the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/).

My goal is to figure out the best way to include the USWDS as global style and as CSS modules for specific components.
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Learn more about USWDS

To learn more about the [**U.S. Web Design Sytem (USWDS)**](https://designsystem.digital.gov/), take a look at the following resources:

- [USWDS system color tokens](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-tokens/color/system-tokens/) - the complete palette of color tokens from which any project can build a theme palette.
- [USWDS utilities](https://designsystem.digital.gov/utilities/) - simple HTML classes typically scoped to a single CSS property like `border-style` or `background-color`. Utilities can be used additively to style an object from scratch or to override a style defined in component CSS.
- [USWDS settings](https://designsystem.digital.gov/documentation/settings/) - the complete list of settings variables that tell the design system how to build.
- [USWDS source on GitHub](https://github.com/uswds/uswds) - the source files that get included via `node_modules`.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/import?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
